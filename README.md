# Morse_GUI  
In this program I've made a GUI application using Qt Creator and made a file to test the led_controller and morse classes and it's methods to test and leave less chances of the program running into some error.  
mainwindow.ui is the xml code generated by the QtCreator for the window design  
 
tester.py is for testing the intented functioning of the program. 
 
Use below picture as a reference for understanding the flow of code:
